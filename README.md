# Express React Starter

This is a template for using Express and React in the same project. It is based on Create React App. The following readme was totally stolen from the sample :)

## Installing

```bash
git clone 'this-repo-url' app-name
cd app-name
npm install
```

## Running The App for Dev

### Start the Express Server

```bash
node server/server.js
```

### Start React Client

In a different terminal tab...

```bash
npm start
```

## Building for Prod

In production, you want Express to serve up your app.

### Build React App

```bash
npm build
```

Visit the Express app at 'http://localhost:3001' and you will see your app served from the 'build' folder
